    <p>This is my first blog post.</p>

<p>Which is public.</p>

<p>Alright.</p>

<p>Alright. Yeah. That’s okay.</p>

<p><br />
I don’t love reading. Fiction has been a fairly small percentage of what I read, and aren’t all those quotes about reading only about fiction anyway? I don’t love reading. Love or hate is not the lens I would approach reading with. It’s what I do. I need it, and not in the romantic sense of the word. It’s mostly pragmatic. I don’t know how to do a lot of things, I don’t know how to think a lot of things, I don’t know how to feel a lot of things. Reading is what solves these little inconveniences for me. Reading to me is all those cliches that a 1860s wife was supposed to be. A sibling, a parent, a teacher, a mentor, a friend, a lover. Most of all, reading is the constant companion, an ever available escape when everything else invariably gets overwhelming.<br /><br /></p>

<p>When I was 17 at a college that I thought I was too good for, and which turned out to be the other way around, I met an amazing senior who said something that influenced my reading for almost the entire decade that followed -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do you read fiction? Fiction is for elevated minds that want to relax? What have you fucking accomplished to deserve it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, I guess. As someone that’s always been into trying to over-optimise his life by gobbling up non-fiction, this advice felt like Jesus’s blood or whatever. I read two or three fiction books a year. The best. All my favourites till date. I guess the greed of consuming the very best literature to make up for the lack of volume pays off.</p>

<p>Cut to 27 and reading fiction is a very natural choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I read fiction to be destroyed by Murakami’s words. <br />
I read fiction to be washed over by the genius and the tragedy that Fitzgerald’s life was.  <br />
I read fiction to be able to feel at least an iota as much as Sylvia Plath did at her numbest.<br />
I read fiction because Kurt Vonnegut isn’t a legend to me, but a best friend who thinks like I do.<br />
I read fiction because Douglas Adams is a master showing kid me the ropes of what is possible.<br />
I read fiction because Amy Hempel makes me feel more worthless than a Wisdom tooth with her word economy.<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
Yeah, reading fiction is a very natural choice. It is a natural choice because I would choose being poor and feel everything I could feel and think everything I could to being successful and shallow. Success can wait.
